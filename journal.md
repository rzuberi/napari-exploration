- Explored how Napari works and its plugins, really just looked at the CellPose integration plugin. Still need to workout how to correct the predictions.
- Had a meeting with Ivor, Helfrid and Ryan for 1 hour where we talked about the features Ryan was collecting on cells, Ivor explained we should explore VAEs to get more features, I talked about my Napari exploration and the 2009 surface curvature histogram paper that Helfrid said was a good start, I proposed to do a Napari presenation to Helfrid's lab and Ivor said I have to make a sketch of what my dissertation will look like.
- I started the GitHub project and started setting up the project with the correct requirements, taking them from the cell-SCT project.
- I need to make a plan of what I want to achieve in the next two weeks for this project.

- I ran into some issues while trying to install napari and run it on the Windows Chichester lab computers, but now it is installed and running and I documented how to do it and avoid the issues I had and how I solved them on the "setup.md" file in this project.
- I followed the tutorial from Napari to create a very basic Napari plugin and then how to do it with cookiecutter (which creates a template for you) and I documented one issue I had (not having installed git before installing cookiecutter with pip) and its solution in the "plugin_creation.md" file in this project.

- I quickly setup Napari on a new Windows computer and made a little correction the the "quick setup" commands, adding the command that pip installs the missing "imageio_ffmpeg" package.
- I read Ivor's email on some thoughts and guidance on the group meetings he will be hosting for his group of 3rd year projects (which I am apart of). I read [this blog on training neural networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) that he recommended in his email.
- I need to get Omero installed on these computers!!!

- So I first want to make my plugin able to read the layers and print their names DONE
- Then I want it to offer a dropdown menu to choose the segmentation layer DONE
- Then I want it to print the count all of the pixels on that segmented layer (the coloured ones) DONE
- Then I want it to print the individual count of all cell masks (for each color: a count) DONE
- Then I want it to average out that number to give the average size of each DONE

Extensions:
- hover over cells to give their size (in number of pixels)
	- add a tooltip so that instead of being printed in the console or anotehr window it is show in a window
		next to the mouse!
- create a mask on the original image of only a certain labelled cells (maybe even from hovered)
- click on a few cells to select them and create a mask just from those
- extract shape information of cells
- get information from a series of images
- match cells on different images

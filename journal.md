- Explored how Napari works and its plugins, really just looked at the CellPose integration plugin. Still need to workout how to correct the predictions.
- Had a meeting with Ivor, Helfrid and Ryan for 1 hour where we talked about the features Ryan was collecting on cells, Ivor explained we should explore VAEs to get more features, I talked about my Napari exploration and the 2009 surface curvature histogram paper that Helfrid said was a good start, I proposed to do a Napari presenation to Helfrid's lab and Ivor said I have to make a sketch of what my dissertation will look like.
- I started the GitHub project and started setting up the project with the correct requirements, taking them from the cell-SCT project.
- I need to make a plan of what I want to achieve in the next two weeks for this project.
